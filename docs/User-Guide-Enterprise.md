# Accessing your AI Co-Pilot

* Open this URL with a browser: <http://localhost:8000/galaxy/chat/> 

## SWIRL Login

*If the SWIRL login page appears*:

![SWIRL Login](images/swirl_login-galaxy_dark.png)

Enter username `admin` and password `password`, then click `Login`.

{: .warning }
If you receive a warning about the password being compromised or in a recent data breach, you [Change the super user password](Admin-Guide.md#changing-a-super-user-password).

## SSO Login

*If your organizations SSO page appears*:

![SSO page]()

Login as you normally would. Regardless of the method you use, if you are successful at logging in, you should be redirected to the AI Co-Pilot:

![Co-Pilot page](images/swirl_copilot_start.png)

If you encounter an error message, [contact support](mailto:support@swirl.today) or your local system administrator.

# Starting a Conversation

* Use the input box to send a message to the Co-Pilot.

A good first question is `What sources do I have access to?`

![Co-Pilot sources question]()

The Co-Pilot should reply within 5 seconds:

![Co-Pilot sources]()

If it doesn't, consult the [NEW TBD Troubleshooting Guide](). 

If the sources it lists don't look correct, check with your system administrator. TBD: link to the solution (how to change description in SP etc)

* From there, converse with the Co-Pilot with the goal of finding some information. It will assist you as much as it can with the knowledge it has; most importantly, it will ask clarifying questions to help you identify the right source(s) to search, and what to search for. 

For example:

![Co-Pilot conversation about SWIRL cyber insurance coverage](images/swirl_copilot_cyberinsurance.png)

# Ending a Conversation

To end a conversation, hit the SWIRL logo at the top of the page. This will start a new conversation. Co-Pilot will not remember or be able to access previous chat sessions UNLESS it has built-in memory of it's own.

# Resuming an Old Conversation

To resume a conversation, construct the URL to the chat session by adding the chat_id:
[http://localhost:8000/galaxy/chat/?chat_id=1](http://localhost:8000/galaxy/chat/?chat_id=1)

As of 3.6, neither Co-Pilot or Galaxy will offer a summary of the conversation so far. It is on the calling application to review the history. Direct access to all previous chats is planned for a future release.

# Restrictions on GAI/LLM

SWIRL AI Co-Pilot imposes no significant restrictions on the capability of the LLM used. While chatting with Co-Pilot you can do anything the LLM supports. 

For example:

* Chatting in one language and querying sources in others - any languages supported by the model

![Co-Pilot chatting in Japanese, querying in English]()

* Translating RAG responses into other languages
